Flare3D Prerelease #2041 (09/06/11) 

About Flare3D PreRelease.

These drops are beta versions of the new Flare3D API providing 3D rendering functionality in Flash Player using Stage3D capabilities. 
The API may change before a final release.
The goal is to get as early as possible feedback on the API while changes are still possible.
A secondary goal is to give you an opportunity to already experiment with the API. 
The binaries have not gone through Quality Assurance and are pure development builds. 

NOTE:

This release requires the lastest Flash Player version you can found here : http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer11.html

To use the new Flash Player, you will need to target SWF version 13 by passing in an extra
compiler argument to the Flex compiler: -swf-version=13.
